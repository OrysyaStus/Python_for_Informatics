# Extracting Data from XML
# In this assignment you will write a Python program somewhat similar to http://www.pythonlearn.com/code/geoxml.py.
# The program will prompt for a URL, read the XML data from that URL using urllib and then parse and extract the comment counts from the XML data,
# compute the sum of the numbers in the file.
# We provide two files for this assignment. One is a sample file where we give you the sum for your testing and the other is the actual data
# you need to process for the assignment.
# Sample data: http://pr4e.dr-chuck.com/tsugi/mod/python-data/data/comments_42.xml (Sum=2553)
# Actual data: http://pr4e.dr-chuck.com/tsugi/mod/python-data/data/comments_174248.xml (Sum ends with 82)
